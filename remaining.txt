Compare the hashmaps of the ships , of the black boxes , passengers carried and the number of boxes carried, cOordinates.
Number of deaths.

problem would be with the number of deaths then. Should be different in all 
Increase the heap size too 
Compareto , Hashcode

FOR RAM / PERFORMANCE PART OF THE REPORT ::
java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version | grep -iE 'heapsize|permsize|threadstacksize'

=> Improvements for later ::
We can just copy the ships from the original node's  ships since that never changes throughout the entire code.

//q: what is  java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space error ?
//a: it means that the heap memory is full and the program can't allocate more memory for the new object.
//q: How can I solve it ?
//a: increase the heap size by using the -Xmx flag when running the program.
//q: any ideas on how to opimitze my code to not fill the heap ?
//a: use the same ships array for all the nodes instead of creating a new one for each node.

//REPORT ::
Memory issue  java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space in df search.
How did we fix it
