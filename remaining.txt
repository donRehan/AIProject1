Compare the hashmaps of the ships , of the black boxes , passengers carried and the number of boxes carried, cOordinates.
Number of deaths.

problem would be with the number of deaths then. Should be different in all 
Increase the heap size too 
Compareto , Hashcode

FOR RAM / PERFORMANCE PART OF THE REPORT ::
java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version | grep -iE 'heapsize|permsize|threadstacksize'

=> Improvements for later ::
We can just copy the ships from the original node's  ships since that never changes throughout the entire code.

//REPORT ::
Memory issue  java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space in df search.
How did we fix it 

>> Create a hashtable with the ships , blackboxes , passengers carried and number of boxes, and the coordinates.

q: How can I silence Exception in thread "main" java.util.ConcurrentModificationException
?
a: Use an iterator instead of a for loop.
q: What does an iteretor mean ?
a: It's a class that allows you to loop through a collection, remove elements during the iteration, and safely handle concurrent modification.
